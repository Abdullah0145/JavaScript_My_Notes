    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 1:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;"> Introduction to the JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is the JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript is a lightweight, object-oriented programming language, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages that is used to make websites more interactive.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> JavaScript is an essential tool for front-end web development, & it is also used on the back end of a web application.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> JavaScript is a popular and widely used language to build a wide range of applications, including mobile applications, desktop applications, and games applications.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> A scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> Enables you to update content dynamically, control multimedia, animate images, and much more..</p>
    <p><b>#</b> We use HTML to structure and give meaning to our web content, CSS to apply styling to our HTML content and javascript to add behaviour aspect and to make the page interactive.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> Javascript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform. JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript translator is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser. </p>
    <p><b>#</b> It is an interpreted, full fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivivty on websites. When applied to an HTML document. JavaScript has no connectivity with java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as cache DB and MongoDB uses javascript as their scripting and query langauage.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 2:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is the extension of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The extension of JavaScript is <b>.js</b></p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 3:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Web pages before JavaScript was introduced?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> Before JavaScript was developed, web pages were static and could not be changed by the user. If a web page needed to display dynamic content or respond to user input, the entire page would have to be reloaded from the server. This made the web a less interactive and responsive experience for users.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 4:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">History of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b></b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript came into the Pictures?</b></p>
    <p><b></b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">The Evolution of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netsacape Communication Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then changed to liveScript, and finally, it was given the name JavaScript to leverage in Netscape Navigator 2.0, a popular web browser of the time.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> In 1996, Javascript was submitted to the Europen Computer Manufactures Association (ECMA) and it was standardized as ECMAScript. This standardized version of JavaScript is still used today and is supported by all modern web browsers like Google chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> In the early days of JavaScript, it was primarily used for simple things like form validation and simple mouse interactions, but as browsers became more powerful and web standards evolved, JavaScript became more widely used for building more complex web applications. With the introduction of popular libraries and frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS, React, and Vue.js, it has become easier to build complex and powerful web applications using JavaScript.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> The emergence of Node.js in 2009 made it possible to run JavaScript on the server side and it become more popular as a full-stack language, allowing for code reuse and sharing between the client side and the server side.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> JavaScript was designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-learn programming language that could be used to add interactivity to web pages. It was originally developed by Netscape, and it was quickly adopted by other web browsers. Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is used on almost every modern web page.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> Now a days, most major online companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all use JavaScript in their products.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 5:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What does JavaScript adds to web development?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> <b>Some specific things that JavaScript adds to web development</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Dynamic content</li>
      <li>Interactivity</li>
      <li>Validation</li>
      <li>Animations</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 6:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript is a popular programming langauage that is widely used to build web applications. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that is run by your web browser rather than on a server. this makes it a good choice for building web appliactions that need to be fast and responsive, as the code is run locally on the user's device rather than having to be sent back and forth between a server and and a client. JavaScript is also used to build mobile apps, create interactive documents, and build server-side applications with the help of runtime environments such as Node.js.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 7:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript has become so popular?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Ease of Use:</b> JavaScript is a high-level language, which means that it is easy to learn and use. It is also dynamically-typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, making it easy to write code quickly.</li>
      <li><b>Cross-platform compatibilities:</b> JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, so you can use it to build web applications that it will run on any device with a web browser.</li>
      <li><b>A large developer community:</b> There is a large and active community of developers who use and contribute to JavaScript, which means that there are many resources available for learning the langauge and getting help when you need it.</li>
      <li><b>Powerful capabilities:</b> JavaScript has a lot of powerful features that allow you to build complex and interactive applications. for example, you can use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page, make asynchronous network request, and work with multimedia and other types of data.</li>
      <li><b>Growing demand:</b> The demand for JavaScript developers is high and continues to grow, making it is good langauage to learn if you want to pursue a career in software development.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 8:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Overview of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> Javascript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, web applications, game development, and lots more. it allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>It is a client-side scripting language, which means that is executed by the web browser on the user's device rather than on a server, allowing for fast and responsive user interactions without the need for a page refresh. it is also an object-oriented langauge, which means it is based on the concept of objects and their methods, allowing for encapsulation and reusability of code.</p>
    <p>Javascript can be added to a web page by including it directly within the HTML file using a script tag, linking to a seprate .js file, or through various frameworks and libraries such as jQuery, React.js, Angular.js and Vue.js, etc..</p>
    <p>JavaScript also has a large and active developer community, and it is a language in high demand for web development, with many resources available for learning the language and getting help when you need it. It is constantly evolving with new updates, enhancements, and new tools. With the rise of web development and the proliferation of web-enabled devices and technology, it has become a must-have skill for any web developer or anyone looking to work in the tech industry.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 9:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is ECMAScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> ECMAScript (often referred to as simply "JavaScript") is a programming language specification standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It was first published in 1997 and is used to create scripts for the web and other environments. JavaScript is the most widely-used implementation of ECMAScript and is supported by all major web browsers.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the language, and specifies how it should be implemented. The specification includes things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data types:</b> ECMAScript supports several data types such as numbers, strings, and objects.</li>
      <li><b>Variables:</b> ECMAScript defines the way variables are declared and used</li>
      <li><b>Expressions and operators:</b> ECMAScript specifies the operators that can be used to manipulate data and create expressions.</li>
      <li><b>Control flow:</b> ECMAScript defines the various control flow statements such as if-else, for, and while loops.</li>
      <li><b>Functions:</b> ECMAScript defines how functions are created, called, and returned</li>
      <li><b>Objects:</b> ECMAScript specifies how to create and manipulate objects, including how to define properties and methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 10:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Versions of ECMAScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> ECMAScript has several versions, with the latest one being ECMAScript 2022 (ES13). Each new version of ECMAScript adds new features and updates the existing ones. The first version was introduced in 1997 as ECMAScript 1. In which they introduced basic JavaScript syntax and features. Major updates in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (2015)  and they make JavaScript a more powerful, expressive, and efficient language, allowing developers to write more maintainable and scalable code.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 11:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Overview of TypeScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features to the dynamic and flexible nature of JavaScript. It is designed to make large-scale JavaScript development more manageable and scalable.</p>
    <p>One of the main features of TypeScript is its support for static type checking. This means that the TypeScript compiler can analyze the code and check for type-related errors, such as passing a string where a number is expected before the code is run. This can help to catch and prevent errors early on in the development process, which can save time and effort in the long run.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet">Ques 12:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet">Where not to Learn / Written / Executes JavaScript codes?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> All the people go to any browser and right click -> Inpect -> go to the console and learn Javascript.  He is not able to learn Javascript professionally.  Because whatever JavaScript you are writing or learning in the console is not modern JavaScript, JavaScript is not learned in this way.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 13:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;"> How is JavaScript executed/run in the console inside the browser?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> There is an engine in the browser, which is executing/running in the console.</p>
    <p><b>There are two types of engines in browsers.</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Rendering engine: (Rendering means HTML, CSS layout has to be applied.)</li>
      <li>Executing Engine: (The executing engine executes your javascript codes.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For years, the execution engine used to come attached to the browser, but then some engineers removed the JavaScript execution engine and some engineers packed the JavaScript execution engine and divided it into different parts, like we used python, C++,  Java, etc.. are able to execute/run, similarly if you install the engine inside your system/laptop, then similarly you will be able to execute JavaScript also standalone.  Now like v8 engine, spidermonkey, etc.. there are many similar engines which have been installed on top of these engines, wrapper engine (wrapper engine means some more utility has been added) which became Node.js node.js is Open-source, Cross-Platform, Javascript Runtime environment. Browser engine understand three things HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
