    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript is a lightweight, object-oriented programming language, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages that is used to make websites more interactive.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> JavaScript is an essential tool for front-end web development, & it is also used on the back end of a web application.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> JavaScript is a popular and widely used language to build a wide range of applications, including mobile applications, desktop applications, and games applications.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> A scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> Enables you to update content dynamically, control multimedia, animate images, and much more..</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> We use HTML to structure and give meaning to our web content, CSS to apply styling to our HTML content and javascript to add behaviour aspect and to make the page interactive.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> Javascript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform. JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript translator is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser. </p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> It is an interpreted, full fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivivty on websites. When applied to an HTML document. JavaScript has no connectivity with java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as cache DB and MongoDB uses javascript as their scripting and query langauage.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b></b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">The Evolution of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netsacape Communication Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then changed to liveScript, and finally, it was given the name JavaScript to leverage in Netscape Navigator 2.0, a popular web browser of the time.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> In 1996, Javascript was submitted to the Europen Computer Manufactures Association (ECMA) and it was standardized as ECMAScript. This standardized version of JavaScript is still used today and is supported by all modern web browsers like Google chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> In the early days of JavaScript, it was primarily used for simple things like form validation and simple mouse interactions, but as browsers became more powerful and web standards evolved, JavaScript became more widely used for building more complex web applications. With the introduction of popular libraries and frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS, React, and Vue.js, it has become easier to build complex and powerful web applications using JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> The emergence of Node.js in 2009 made it possible to run JavaScript on the server side and it become more popular as a full-stack language, allowing for code reuse and sharing between the client side and the server side.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> JavaScript was designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-learn programming language that could be used to add interactivity to web pages. It was originally developed by Netscape, and it was quickly adopted by other web browsers. Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is used on almost every modern web page.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>#</b> Now a days, most major online companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all use JavaScript in their products.</p>
    <hr class="hr"/>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 9:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is ECMAScript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> ECMAScript (often referred to as simply "JavaScript") is a programming language specification standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It was first published in 1997 and is used to create scripts for the web and other environments. JavaScript is the most widely-used implementation of ECMAScript and is supported by all major web browsers.</p>
    <p class="para2">ECMAScript defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the language, and specifies how it should be implemented. The specification includes things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><b>Data types:</b> ECMAScript supports several data types such as numbers, strings, and objects.</li>
      <li class="list"><b>Variables:</b> ECMAScript defines the way variables are declared and used</li>
      <li class="list"><b>Expressions and operators:</b> ECMAScript specifies the operators that can be used to manipulate data and create expressions.</li>
      <li class="list"><b>Control flow:</b> ECMAScript defines the various control flow statements such as if-else, for, and while loops.</li>
      <li class="list"><b>Functions:</b> ECMAScript defines how functions are created, called, and returned</li>
      <li class="list"><b>Objects:</b> ECMAScript specifies how to create and manipulate objects, including how to define properties and methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr class="hr"/>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 10:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Versions of ECMAScript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> ECMAScript has several versions, with the latest one being ECMAScript 2022 (ES13). Each new version of ECMAScript adds new features and updates the existing ones. The first version was introduced in 1997 as ECMAScript 1. In which they introduced basic JavaScript syntax and features. Major updates in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (2015)  and they make JavaScript a more powerful, expressive, and efficient language, allowing developers to write more maintainable and scalable code.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 11:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Overview of TypeScript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features to the dynamic and flexible nature of JavaScript. It is designed to make large-scale JavaScript development more manageable and scalable.</p>
    <p class="para2">One of the main features of TypeScript is its support for static type checking. This means that the TypeScript compiler can analyze the code and check for type-related errors, such as passing a string where a number is expected before the code is run. This can help to catch and prevent errors early on in the development process, which can save time and effort in the long run.</p>

        <li class="list"><b>Scalable:</b>  Node.js is a single-threaded program, 'Which means that it can only handle one task at a time. However, it can handle a large number of connections at the same time without any delay. This is What makes Node.js very scalable. Because it can Candle many connections simultaneously, it can handle a large number of requests and provide a fast response time, making it a great option for building scalable applications that can handle a lot of traffic.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Speed:</b>  Non-blocking thread execution means that Node.js can run multiple tasks at the same time without having to wait for one task to finish before starting another. This makes Node.js faster and more efficient because it can work on multiple tasks simultaneously, rather than having to wait for one task to finish before starting another. This allows Node.js to handle a large number of tasks with fewer resources and less delay.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Packages:</b>  A vast set of open-source Node.js packages is available that can simplify your work. There are more than one million packages in the NPM ecosystem today.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Multi-platform:</b>  Cross-platform support allows you to create SaaS websites, desktop apps, and even mobile apps, all using Node.js.</li>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 16:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is Runtime?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> Runtime is a piece of code that implements portions of a programming language's execution model. Doing this, allows the program to interact with the computing resources it needs to work? Runtimes are often integral parts of the programming language and dont't need to be installed separately</p>
    <p class="para2">Runtime is also when a program is running? That is, when you start a program running on a computer, it is a runtime for that program? In some programming languages, certain reusable programs or "routines" are built and packaged as a "runtime library?" These "routines" can be linked to and used by any program when it is running</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 17:</b><b style="color: blueviolet;">What is Runtime in JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> In JavaScript, runtime refers to the period during which a JavaScript program is executed by a JavaScript engine. When a JavaScript program is loaded into a web page or runs using a command-line tool, the JavaScript engine starts to execute the code. The JavaScript engine follows a set of rules, known as the JavaScript specification, to interpret and execute the code.</p>
    <p class="para2">During runtime, the JavaScript engine creates an execution context, a data structure containing the variables, functions, and other resources needed to execute the code. The engine then starts to execute the code, line by line, in the order it appears in the program</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that only one task can be executed at a time. However, JavaScript provides mechanisms such a callbacks and promises, to handle asynchronous operations and avoid blocking the execution of the code</p>
    <p class="para2">It's worth noting that JavaScript's runtime is different from other languages' runtime as when it is used for developing web applications, it runs on the browser on client side  and for server side programming , it is run with Node.js. So the environment and the runtime are different.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 18:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">How does JavaScript Runtime work?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript runtime works by interpreting and executing JavaScript code. When a JavaScript program is loaded into a web page or runs using a command-line tool, the JavaScript engine starts to execute the code. The engine follows a set of rules, known as the JavaScript specification, to interpret and execute the code.</p>
    <p class="para2">The JavaScript engine creates an execution context for each function call and a global execution context for the entire program. The execution context contains the variables, functions, and other resources needed to execute the code. The engine then starts to execute the code, line by line, in the order it appears in the program.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that only one task can be executed at a time. However, JavaScript provides mechanisms such as callbacks and promises, to handle asynchronous operations and avoid blocking the execution of the code.</p>
    <p class="para2">The JavaScript engine also includes a garbage collector, which constantly monitors the heap and frees up memory that is no longer being used. This is done in a way that does not interrupt the program execution.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript runtime in a browser is executed in a sandboxed environment, which means that it is limited in the resources it can access and what it can do. This is to protect the user's computer from malicious code. For example, JavaScript code running in a browser cannot access the user's file system or make arbitrary network connections.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript runtime on the server side, with Node.js, has more freedom and can access the file system, network resources, and more. The runtime is also different as it uses the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google instead of the browser's JavaScript engine.</p>
    <p class="para2">In summary, JavaScript runtime works by interpreting and executing JavaScript code in the order it appears. The JavaScript engine creates execution contexts, manages the execution flow, and handles memory management through garbage collection. The runtime also has some limitations in a browser environment to protect the user's computer.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 19:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is V8?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google which is used in the Google Chrome browser and also used in the runtime environment for Node JS. It's responsible for executing JavaScript code within the browser, parsing and compiling JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution.</p>
    <p class="para2">V8 is known for its high performance, scalability, and compatibility with modern JavaScript features and APIs. The engine is implemented in C++ and is designed to handle complex, large-scale JavaScript applications, making it ideal for use in high-performance web browsers and server-side JavaScript environments.</p>
    <p class="para2">The source code for V8 is freely available, allowing developers to contribute to its development and use it in their own projects. The V8 project has been actively maintained and developed by Google since its creation, and it continues to be a critical component of the Google Chrome browser and other web-based applications</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 20:</b><b style="color: blueviolet;">What are the Key features of V8?</b></p>

        <li class="list"><b>Asynchronous I/O:</b> The core of libuv is its support for asynchronous I/O. The library provides APIs for working with file system operations, network communication, and other I/O operations that can take 
        time to complete. These APIs allow developers to perform I/O operations in an asynchronous manner, which can improve the performance and scalability of their applications.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Event Loop:</b> libuv provides an event loop that allows developers to write asynchronous code in a simple and straight-forward manner. The event loop listens for events, such as the completion of an I/O operation, and dispatches a callback function to handle the event. This allows developers to write code that is responsive and efficient, without having to deal with complex multi-threading or blocking I/O operations.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Thread Pool:</b> libuv provides a thread pool that allows developers to perform blocking I/O operations in a separate thread, freeing up the main thread to continue processing other events. This can improve the performance and scalability of applications, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Process management:</b> libuv provides APIs for working with processes, including process creation, process control, and process signals. This makes it easy to build multi-process applications, such as servers, that can take advantage of multiple cores or processors.</li>
        <li class="list"><b>Open-Source:</b> libuv is an open-source project and is freely available for use. The source code is available on GitHub, and the library is actively maintained by a large and active community of contributors and users.</li>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 35:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Assigning values to variables?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> Storing data in a variable is also called assigning a value to a variable. To store data in a variable(assign value to a variable), use the = symbol. Place the variable name on the left side of the = symbol and place the value to store in the variable goes on the right side of the = symbol.</p>
    <p class="para2">The = symbol is called the assignment operator. We will look into operators in depth in further lectures</p>
    <p class="para2">Variables can be created before assigning values to them.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Example:</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>var name = "PW Skills";</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>console.log(name)</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Output:</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>PW Skills</b></p>
    <p class="para2">Whenever we create a variable without assigning a value to it, by default javascript stores undefined [absence of the value].</p>
    <p class="para2">Values can also be assigned to variables at the moment of creating them. Creating variables and assigning values to them at the same time is known as initializing a variable.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Example:</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>var name = "PW Skills";</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>var students = 12345678;</b></p>

    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green">Ans:</b> The "typeof" operator is a JavaScript operator that allows checking the data type of a given variable. It can be used with any data type, including objects, arrays, and even null values</p>
    <p class="para2">typeof operator is very useful for determining the data type of a given variable. In addition, it can also be used to check for null values.</p>

    <p class="para2"><b>console.log(typeof endDate); // undefined</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>console.log(typeof studentsEnrolled); // number</b></p>
    <P class="para2">There are a few benefits to using the "typeof" operator in JavaScript. First, it is a convenient way to check if a variable is of a certain data type without having to check for conditions. Second, it can be used as a debugging tool to help check why a particular piece of code is not working as expected if any datatype issues. Finally, it can help prevent errors in code by giving a clear understanding of the data types that are being used.</P>

    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The "typeof" operator can be used to detect errors in the code. If we try to access a variable that has not been declared, we will get an error message. This is because "typeof" returns "undefined" for undeclared variables</p>

    <p class="para2">The data type is a classification of data according to the type of value that we want to operate on.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means the data type is defined by the engine itself during execution, the programmer need not explicitly declare the data type during defining.

    <ol type="1">
      <li class="list"><b>JavaScript Arithmetic Operators:</b> Arithmetic Operators are used to perform airthmetic operations on the operands.</li>
      <p class="para2">We use arithmetic operators to do mathematical operations like (+)addition, (-)subtraction, (*)multiplication, (/)division, (%)Modulus/Modulo, (++)Increment, (--)Decrement etc. It simply takes numerical values as operands, performs an arithmetic operation, and returns a numerical value</p>
      <p class="para2">Addition (+): Adds two values together.</p>
      <p class="para2">Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another.</p>
      <p class="para2">Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values together.</p>
      <p class="para2">Division (/): Divides one value by another</p>
      <p class="para2">Modulus(%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.</p>
      <p class="para2">Exponentiation(**): raises to the power of.</p>
      <p class="para2">Increment Operator(++): Increases the value by 1.</p>
      <p class="para2">Decrement Operator(--): Decreases the value by 1.</p>
      <p class="para2">In JavaScript, the "++" operator is used for both pre-increment and post-increment operations. Pre increment operator increments the value and returns the incremented value immediately. Post increment operator increments the value but returns the original value itself. The same follows with Pre decrement and Post decrement operators.</p>
      <p class="para2"  ><b>Note:</b> Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:</p>

    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b>Programming Languages are tools that allow us to write code that instructs the computer to do something. In every programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs.</p>
    <p class="para2">Human beings make decisions all the time. For example, every morning, we make a decision between eating or not eating before starting our daily chores. Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision-making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 46:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What is Conditionals in JavaSc8ipt?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive and dynamic elements on wwbsites. One of the key features of JavaScript is the ability to use conditional statements to control the flow of a program.</p>
    <p class="para2">Conditions work on boolean values, true or false. It is true if it meets the requirement, false otherwise. That is expressions (conditions) are evaluated to be either true or false.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 47:</b><b style="color: blueviolet;">What are the ways of writing conditionals in Javascript?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> <b>There are three ways of writing conditionals in Javascript.</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">If/else Statement</li>
      <li class="list">Switch Statement</li>
      <li class="list">Ternary Operator</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 48:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Introduction to if, if-else, and if-else if?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The most basic form of a conditional statement is the <mark>if statement.</mark> The syntax for an <mark>if statement</mark> is as follows:</p>
    <div class="div">
    <p><b>if (condition) { </b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if the condition is true</b></p>
    <p> } </p>
    </div>
    <p class="para2">The condition is any expression that can be evaluated as true or false. For example, you can use a comparison operator (such as <, >, == to compare) to values, or you can use a logical operator (such as &&, ||) to combine multiple conditions.</p>
    <p class="para2">An if statement can also include an optional else statement, which will execute if the condition is false. The syntax for an <mark>if-else statement</mark> is as follows:</p>
    <div class="div">
    <p><b>if (condition) { </b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if the condition is true</b></p>
    <p><b>} else { </b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if the condition is false</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    </div>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript also supports the use of else if statement, which allows you to chain multiple conditions together. The syntax for an <mark>if else-if else statement</mark> is as follows:</p>
    <div class="div">
    <p><b>if (condition1) { </b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if condition1 is true</b></p>
    <p><b>} else if (condition2) { </b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true</b></p>
    <p><b>} else { </b></p>
    <p><b> // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are both false</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    </div>
    <p class="para2">You can chain as many else if as you want.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript also has a <mark>ternary operator</mark>, which is a shorthand way to write a simple if-else statement. The syntax for a ternary operator is as follows:</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Condition ? true-expression: false-expression;</b></p>
    <p class="para2">It is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement.</p>
    <p class="para2">JavaScript also has a <mark>switch statement</mark>. A switch statement allows you to check for multiple conditions and execute different codes depending on the value of a particular expression. The syntax for a switch statement is as follows:</p>
    <div class="div">
    <p><b>switch (expression) { </b></p>
    <p><b>case value1:</b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if expression == value1</b></p>
    <p><b>break;</b></p>
    <p><b>case value2:</b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if expression == value2</b></p>
    <p><b>break;</b></p>
    <p><b>default:</b></p>
    <p><b>// code to be executed if the expression is not equal to any of the values</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    </div>
    <p class="para2">The switch statement is useful when you have a large number of conditions to check and the conditions are based on the value of a single expression.</p>
    <p class="para2"><mark>Conditional statements</mark> in JavaScript are an important tool for controlling the flow of a program. They allow you to execute different codes depending on the outcome of an evaluation, and they come in several forms: if-else, else-if, ternary operator, and switch statement. Understanding how and when to use these statements is essential for writing effective JavaScript code.</p>
    <p class="para2">Let's understand the basic conditionals which are if, if-else, and if-else-if. To understand these concepts we will be looking into a simple example problem.</p>
    <p class="para2">The if, else, and else if keywords are used in programming to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These conditions are typically evaluated as either true or false.</p>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 49:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Check if the given number is even or odd?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Ans:</b>The challenge here is to find out if the given number is even or odd.</p>
    <p class="para2">Before, solving any problem through programming it is important to first analyze what is the input that will be taken, what the conditionals involved, and what the output expected.</p>
    <p class="para2">In this case, we will be taking integers are input. The output is expected to be a message telling if the number is even or odd.</p>
    <p class="para2">The conditions to be considered to solve this problem are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</li>
      <li class="list">Any number that is not completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an odd number.</li>
      <li class="list">Zero is neither an odd number nor an even number.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para2">Let's look at each condition one by one.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>var num = 10;</b></p>
    <p class="para2">In the above block of code, we have declared a variable named "num" and assigned it the value of 10. The variable num will be our input.</p>
    <p class="para2">Now let's handle the condition number 01 that is if any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</p>
    <p class="para2">To check if the number is completely divisible by 2 we will be making use of the modulo operator which returns the remainder. If the result of the modulo operation is 0 then the number is even.</p>
    <p class="para2">From the previous lecture, we know the syntax of the if statement, and we will write the code considering the same syntax.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b>var num = 10;</b></p>
    <p><b>// Condition 01: Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num % 2 == 0) { </b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b> }</b></p>
    <p>This code block checks if the variable "num" is an even number using an if statement. The if statement checks the condition num % 2 == 0. </p>
    <p>The modulus operator % is used to find the remainder of dividing the variable "num" by 2.</p>
    <p>If the remainder is 0, it means that the number is completely divisible by 2 and it is an even number.</p>
    <p>If the condition is true, the code inside the if block will be executed, which is console.log("The number given is an even number");. This will output the message "The number given is an even number" to the console, confirming that the number is even.</p><p><b></b></p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 10; // Output: The number given is an even number</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 02: Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num % 2 == 0) { </b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    <p>If the condition is false, the code inside the if block will not be executed, and this code will not give any output.</p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 11; // Output:</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 03: Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num % 2 == 0) { </b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    <p>Since we are not getting any output if the condition is false. It's time to handle the second condition which is any number that is not completely divisible [ remainder must be 0 ] by 2 then it is an odd number</p>
    <p>As we have already checked for the even number condition, now if the condition for even fails it is an odd number. We can check this through the else statement.</p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 11; // Output: The number given is an odd number</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 04: Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num % 2 == 0) {</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b>} else {</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an odd number");</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 10; // Output: The number given is an even number</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 05: Any number that is completely divisible [ remainder must be 0 ] by 2 then it is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num % 2 == 0) {</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b>} else {</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an odd number");</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    <p>Now the code is capable of checking if the given number is odd or even.</p>
    <p>We also have our third condition which is zero is neither an odd number nor an even number. So the first condition we need to check is if the number is zero, then if the number is even, and at last, if both the condition fails it is an odd number.</p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 10; // Output: The number given is an even number</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 06: Zero is neither an odd number nor an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num == 0) {</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("Zero is neither an odd number nor an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b>} else if (num % 2 == 0) {</b></p>
    <p><b>// Condition 07: Any number that is completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an even number");</b></p>
    <p><b>} else {</b></p>
    <p><b>// Condition 08: Any number that is not completely divisible [remainder must be 0] by 2 then it is an odd number.</b></p>
    <p><b>console.log("The number given is an odd number");</b></p>
    <p><b> } </b></p>
    <p><b>// Input</b></p>
    <p>var num = 11; // Output: The number given is an odd number</p>
    <p><b>// Condition 09: Zero is neither an odd number nor an even number.</b></p>
    <p><b>if (num == 0) {</b></p>

    <p><b>Nested for loop</b></p>
    <p>An outer for loop and one or more inside for loops constitute a nested for loop. Control re-enters the inner for loop and initiates a fresh execution every time the outer for loop repeats</p>
    <p>In other words, every time the outer for loop repeats, the control will enter the inner for loop.</p>
    <p>Nested for loop often looks like this.</p>

    <img src="./assets/Break Statement Output.png" alt="Break Statement Output" title="Break Statement Output" width="500px" height="200px"/>
    <p>Here, we use an if statement inside the loop. If the current value of i becomes 2, the if statement will execute and the break statement will terminate the loop.</p>
    <p>That is why we only see numbers till 2 in the output.</p>
    <p><b>Example of using break with while loop</b></p>
    <p>We will take the same example and see if it works in while loop</p>
    <p>let i = 0;</p>

    <p>Here again, we have used an if statement to check the condition for break, the moment i becomes 3, if statement is executed leading to loop termination.</p>
    <p>Notice and observe the difference between for and while loops for getting the same result.</p>

    <p><b>Ques 56:</b> <b>Explain Continue Statement in JavaScript? Give the Example of Continue Statement in JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b>The current iteration of the loop is skipped when using the continue statement, and the program moves on to the subsequent iteration.</p>
    <p><b>The syntax of the continue statement is:</b></p>
    <p>continue [label];</p>
    <p>label is optional and rarely used.</p>

    <p><b>Example of using continue in for loop</b></p>
    <p><b>Write a program to display only odd numbers till 20:</b></p>
    <p>for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {</p>
    <p>if (i % 2 = = = 0) {</p>
    <p>continue;</p>
    <p> } </p>
    <p>console.log(i);</p>
    <p> } </p>
    <p><b>Output:</b></p>
    <img src="./assets/Continue with for loop Output.png" alt="Continue with for loop Output" title="Continue with for loop" width="300px" height="200px"/>
    <p>Here, the for loop iterates through the values from 0 to 20.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the division of the current value of i by 2 is returned by the i%2 expression.</p>
    <p>The continue statement, which skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the iterator expression i++, is executed if the remainder is zero. If not, the value of i is output to the console.</p>
    <p><b>Example of using continue in while loop</b></p>
    <p>We will use the same example here and implement it with while loop</p>
    <p><b>Write a program to display only odd numbers till 20</b></p>
    <p>let i = 0;</p>
    <p>while (i < 20) {</p>
    <p>i++;</p>
    <p>if (i % 2 = = = 0) {</p>
    <p>continue;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>console.log(i);</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p><b>Output:</b></p>
    <img src="./assets/Continue with while loop Output.png" alt="Continue with while loop" title="Continue with while loop" width="400px" height="300px"/>
    <p>Here, the while loop iterates through the values in this example from 0 to 20.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the division of the current value of i by 2 is returned by the i%2 expression.</p>
    <p>The continue statement, which skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the iterator expression i++, is executed if the remainder is zero. If not, the value of i is output to the console.</p>
    <p><b>We can also use a label here, to print the same result. If you are wondering how, here it is:</b></p>
    <p>Labelex:</p>
    <P>for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {</P>
    <P>if (i % 2 = = = 0) {</P>
    <P>continue labelex;</P>
    <P>}</P>
    <P>console.log(i);</P>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>Here, the continue statement skips the execution and takes it to labelex.</p>
    <p>You can use a label to identify a loop and the continue statement, here, to tell a program whether to skip the loop or keep running it. Note that JavaScript has no goto statement(as in C/C++); you can only use labels with break and continue.</p>
    <p>Labeled loops are easier to track and understand with respect to program flow in case of continue.</p>
