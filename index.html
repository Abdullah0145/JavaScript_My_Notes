    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 3:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Web pages before JavaScript was introduced?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> Before JavaScript was developed, web pages were static and could not be changed by the user. If a web page needed to display dynamic content or respond to user input, the entire page would have to be reloaded from the server. This made the web a less interactive and responsive experience for users.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 4:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">History of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b></b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript came into the Pictures?</b></p>
    <p><b></b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">OR:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">The Evolution of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netsacape Communication Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then changed to liveScript, and finally, it was given the name JavaScript to leverage in Netscape Navigator 2.0, a popular web browser of the time.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> In 1996, Javascript was submitted to the Europen Computer Manufactures Association (ECMA) and it was standardized as ECMAScript. This standardized version of JavaScript is still used today and is supported by all modern web browsers like Google chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> In the early days of JavaScript, it was primarily used for simple things like form validation and simple mouse interactions, but as browsers became more powerful and web standards evolved, JavaScript became more widely used for building more complex web applications. With the introduction of popular libraries and frameworks like jQuery, AngularJS, React, and Vue.js, it has become easier to build complex and powerful web applications using JavaScript.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> The emergence of Node.js in 2009 made it possible to run JavaScript on the server side and it become more popular as a full-stack language, allowing for code reuse and sharing between the client side and the server side.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> JavaScript was designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-learn programming language that could be used to add interactivity to web pages. It was originally developed by Netscape, and it was quickly adopted by other web browsers. Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is used on almost every modern web page.</p>
    <p><b>#</b> Now a days, most major online companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all use JavaScript in their products.</p>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 5:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">How does JavaScript add to web development?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> <b>Some specific things that JavaScript adds to web development</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Dynamic content</li>
      <li>Interactivity</li>
      <li>Validation</li>
      <li>Animations</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 6:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> JavaScript is a popular programming langauage that is widely used to build web applications. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that is run by your web browser rather than on a server. this makes it a good choice for building web appliactions that need to be fast and responsive, as the code is run locally on the user's device rather than having to be sent back and forth between a server and and a client. JavaScript is also used to build mobile apps, create interactive documents, and build server-side applications with the help of runtime environments such as Node.js.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 7:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">Why JavaScript has become so popular?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Ease of Use:</b> JavaScript is a high-level language, which means that it is easy to learn and use. It is also dynamically-typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, making it easy to write code quickly.</li>
      <li><b>Cross-platform compatibilities:</b> JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, so you can use it to build web applications that it will run on any device with a web browser.</li>
      <li><b>A large developer community:</b> There is a large and active community of developers who use and contribute to JavaScript, which means that there are many resources available for learning the langauge and getting help when you need it.</li>
      <li><b>Powerful capabilities:</b> JavaScript has a lot of powerful features that allow you to build complex and interactive applications. for example, you can use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page, make asynchronous network request, and work with multimedia and other types of data.</li>
      <li><b>Growing demand:</b> The demand for JavaScript developers is high and continues to grow, making it is good langauage to learn if you want to pursue a career in software development.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet">Ques 8:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet">Where not to Learn / Written / Executes JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> All the people go to any browser and right click -> Inpect -> go to the console and learn Javascript.  He is not able to learn Javascript professionally.  Because whatever JavaScript you are writing or learning in the console is not modern JavaScript, JavaScript is not learned in this way.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 9:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">But, How is JavaScript executed / run in the console inside the browser?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> There is an engine in the browser, which is executing/running in the console.</p>
    <p><b>There are two types of engines in browsers.</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Rendering engine (Rendering means HTML, CSS layout has to be applied.)</li>
      <li>Executing Engine (Executing Engine )</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For years, the execution engine used to come attached to the browser, but then some engineers removed the JavaScript execution engine and some engineers packed the JavaScript execution engine and divided it into different parts, like we used python, C++,  Java, etc.. are able to execute/run, similarly if you install the engine inside your system/laptop, then similarly you will be able to execute JavaScript also standalone.  Now like v8 engine, spidermonkey, etc.. there are many similar engines which have been installed on top of these engines, wrapper engine (wrapper engine means some more utility has been added) which became Node.js node.js is Open-source, Cross-Platform, Javascript Runtime environment. Browser engine understand three things HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b style="color: blueviolet;">Ques 10:</b> <b style="color: blueviolet;">What are the runtime environments of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b>The Runtime environments of JavaScript are:</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Bun</li>
      <li>Deno</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b>Ques 11:</b> <b>What are the features of javascript?</b></p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> <b>Features of JavaScript are:</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>All popular web browsers support javascript as they provide built-in executions environments</li>
      <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming langauge. thus, it is a structured Programming language.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types  are implictly cost</li>
      <li>Javascript is an object-oriented programming langauge, where it is also use as prototypes rather than using classes for inhertance</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a lightweight and interpreted langauge</li>
      <li>JavaScript is a case-sensitive langauge</li>
      <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including Windows, MacOS, linux, etc.</li>
      <li>JavaScript provides good control to the users over the web browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b>Ques 12:</b> <b>What are the Applications of JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> <b>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:</b></p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Client-side Validation</li>
      <li>Dynamic drop-down menus</li>
      <li>Dispalying date and time</li>
      <li>Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes.</li>
      <li>Displaying clocks etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><b>Ques 13:</b> <b>What are the Three places to put JavaScript code?
      Give the Syntax, example and output?</b></p>
      <p><b>Ans:</b> <b>JavaScript example easy to code, JavaScript provides Three places to put the JavaScript code:</b></p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>With-in the body tag</li>
        <li>With-in the head tag</li>
        <li>external Javascript file</li>
      </ol>
      <img src="./assets/JavaScriptExample.png">
      <p>The script tag specifies that we are using JavaScript. The text / JavaScript is the content type that provides information to the browser about the data. The <u><b>document.write()function</b></u> is used to dispaly dynamic content through JavaScript. We will learn about document object in details later.</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li><b>JavaScript Example: Code between the body tag:</b></li>
        <p>In the above example, we have displayed the dynamic content using Javascript. Let's see the simple example of javaScript that displays alert dialog box.</p>
        <img src="./assets/JavaScriptExampleusingbodytag.png">
        <li><b>JavaScript Example: code between the head tag:</b></li>
        <p>We are creating a function <b>msg().</b> To create function in JavaScript. You need to write function with <b>function_name</b> as given below.</p>
        <p>To call function, you need to work on event here we are using onclick event to call msg() function.</p>
        <img src="./assets/JavaScriptExampleusingheadtag.png">
        <li><b>JavaScript Example: External JavaScript file:</b></li>
        <p>We can create external JavaScript file and embed it many html page.</p>
        <p>It Provides code re-usability bcause single javascript file can be used in several html pages.</p>
        <p>At external javaScript file must be saved by js extension. It is recommended to embed all JavaScript files into a single file. It increase the speed of the web page. Let's create an external Javascript.</p>
        <img src="./assets/JavaScriptExampleusingExternalJS.png">
        <p>Let's include the JavaScript file into html page. It calls the JavaScript function on button click.</p>
